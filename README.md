# Denver Metro Air Quality: Influence on Hospital Death Rates
# Introduction

The link between air-quality and heath outcomes has been known essentially forever; humans likely observed death from excessive smoke inhalation prior to mastering fire. More recently the link between less observable poor air quality and harmful health outcomes has been estabolished (1). The chemical reaction known as combistion decreases the size and changes the nature of reactants into small harmful gases, some of which are called particulate matter (PM). Inhalation of PM can interfer with cellular processes by being mistaken for forgein bodies leading to inflammatory events and from direct damage to cells.

# Question:
Can I detect any relationships among the air quality measures of PM 2.5 & PM 10 with emergencey room visits for Colorado?

# Data:
The EPA has archives of air quality measures with columns of interest for various measures (2).
I was able to locate national hospital data for weekly death counts by cause (3).

The data was well organized and did not require much text cleaning.
