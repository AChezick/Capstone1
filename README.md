# Denver Metro Air Quality: Influence on overall Hospital Death Rates for Inflammatory related events?
# Introduction

The link between air-quality and heath outcomes has been known ,essentially, forever; humans likely observed death from excessive smoke inhalation prior to mastering fire. <  cave man pic? > More recently the link between less observable air quality measures and harmful health outcomes has been established (1). 

The chemical reaction of combustion decreases the sample size of matter and changes the nature of reactants into small harmful gases, some of which are measured and referred to as particulate matter (PM). < inflammation ?   > Inhalation of PM can interfere with cellular processes by being mistaken for foreign bodies leading to inflammatory events and from direct damage to cellular proteins leading to aberrant processes.


<   >


Chronic inhalation for the measures of PM 2.5 and PM 10 have been shown to cause inflammation of the lungs and other tissues, which can lead to secondary events such at heart attacks, strokes, even inflammation of the kidney. PM 2.5 measures reflect particulates that are about 1/35 the width of a human hair or as the name implies 2.5 microns (5). Particulates that measure positive for PM 2.5 are typically produced from combustion events such as metals metals. However, other organic compounds / proteins can be found in this range. PM 10 examples include dust, mold and and about 1/5th the size of a human hair (5).

# Question:

Can I detect any relationships among the air quality measures of PM 2.5 & PM 10 with emergency room visits for all of Colorado?

### Hypothesis (qualitative) 

Ho: I **will NOT** be able to detect significant increased differences in average death events at 0 or +1 weeks of high PM levels.

Ho: I **will** be able to detect significant increased differences in average death events at 0 or +1 weeks of high PM levels.

## Rational:

*According to data form Wikipedia(4) roughly 3 million of Colorado's six-million residents reside within the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Metropolitan area.

If there are any impacts from poor air quality on hospital death rates, this area is *more likely* than any other to have impacts on the overall death rates.


# Data & Processing:
The Environmental Protection Adgencey (EPA) has archives of air quality measures with columns of interest for various measures (2). I used data from their AirNow program, which uses a mix of fully and non-fully verrifed data. Not all data was certifed through the regulatory processes associated with the EPA Air Quality System and **cannot** be used to inform regulation decisions.

Impacts on death rates was assessed data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). I was able to locate national hospital data for weekly death counts by cause (3). These data **do not represent the total amount of deaths in Colorado during that week**. 

The data was well organized and did not require much text cleaning*. However, determining how to grab data to perform the hypothesis test was considerable. As having different numbers of PM measures for PM 2.5 and PM 10 at each site for each day/week equates to a complex 'standard' code block for required alignments.

I combined two similar data frames to create the master data frame for death events. After cleaning the data frame was 313:14.

Something to note is the POC column. This column and value indicates the observation number for that particular site. Since there are 13 different sites with 1-3 measures for PM 2.5 and PM 10 (and in no particular pattern for the number of measures per site per day) taking the average of all measures for each site ID for each day. My ending air quality data frame had roughly 25,000 entries post processing.

Datetime indexing was completed so I could reindex this data frame and aggregrate by date into weeks for each site ID. Due to large gaps and wanting the most overlap of PM 2.5 & PM 10 measures, I chose the three sites that had the most data points.

# Visulation

Starting with the overview. You can see the average annual PM 10 numbers are consistent. The average of all the years 22.7

# Further exploration
This capstone is far from a complete analysis. Only 4 of 13 sites were used to correlate with significant death events.
